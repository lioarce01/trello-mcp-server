cd trello-mcp-server
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash

   - Copy your API Key

2. **Get your Token:**
   - On the same page, click on "Token" link
   - Authorize the application and copy your Token

## Configuration

### For Claude Desktop

Add the server configuration to your Claude Desktop config file:

**Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`  
**macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`  
**Linux:** `~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "trello-mcp": {
        "command": "node",
        "args": [
          "absolute/path/to/the/project/dist/index.js",
          "TRELLO_API_KEY",
          "TRELLO_TOKEN"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### For VS Code with GitHub Copilot Chat

Add to your VS Code settings.json:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "trello-mcp": {
        "command": "node",
        "args": [
          "absolute/path/to/the/project/dist/index.js",
          "TRELLO_API_KEY",
          "TRELLO_TOKEN"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Important:**

- Replace `absolute/path/to/the/project/dist/index.js` with the actual absolute path to your compiled server file
- Replace `TRELLO_API_KEY` and `TRELLO_TOKEN` with your actual Trello credentials

## Quick Test

To test if your server works correctly:

1. **Build the project:**

```bash
pnpm run build
```

2. **Run with credentials:**

```bash
node dist/index.js YOUR_TRELLO_API_KEY YOUR_TRELLO_TOKEN
```

3. **You should see:**

```
Trello MCP server connected and ready.
```

**Note:** The server will wait for MCP client connections. To exit, press `Ctrl+C`.

Once configured, you can interact with your Trello boards through natural language:

### List Boards

```
Show me all my Trello boards
```

### Read Board Contents

```
What cards are in my "Project Management" board?
```

### Create Cards

```
Create a new card called "Review documentation" in the "To Do" list
```

### Move Cards

```
Move the "Bug fix" card to the "In Progress" list
```

### Add Comments

```
Add a comment to the card saying "This needs urgent attention"
```

### Archive Cards

```
Archive the completed card "Setup database"
```

## Available Resources

- **Content:** JSON containing all lists and cards for the board

## Development

### Project Structure

```
trello-mcp-server/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts          # Main server implementation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dist/             # Compiled JavaScript (generated)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tsconfig.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

### Building

```bash
npm run build
```

### Running in Development

To run the server directly (for testing):

```bash
# With npm
npm run build
node dist/index.js YOUR_TRELLO_API_KEY YOUR_TRELLO_TOKEN

# With pnpm
pnpm run build
node dist/index.js YOUR_TRELLO_API_KEY YOUR_TRELLO_TOKEN
```

### Development Scripts

You can also create a development script in your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node dist/index.js",
    "start:dev": "node dist/index.js YOUR_API_KEY YOUR_TOKEN",
    "build": "tsc",
    "dev": "tsc && node dist/index.js YOUR_API_KEY YOUR_TOKEN"
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Server Not Connecting

1. **Check credentials:** Make sure you're passing API Key and Token as arguments
2. **Verify file path:** Ensure the path in your MCP configuration is correct
3. **Build first:** Always run `npm run build` or `pnpm run build` before testing
4. **Test standalone:** Try running `node dist/index.js YOUR_KEY YOUR_TOKEN` first
5. **Restart client:** Restart your MCP client (Claude Desktop/VS Code) after config changes

### Invalid Credentials Error

- Double-check your Trello API Key and Token
- Ensure the token has the necessary permissions
- Try regenerating your token if it's expired

### Tools Not Working

- Verify the board/card/list IDs are correct
- Check that you have write permissions to the Trello board
- Look at the console logs for detailed error messages

### Debug Mode

Run the server with debug output:

```bash
node dist/index.js YOUR_API_KEY YOUR_TOKEN 2>&1 | tee debug.log
```

## Security Notes

- **Never commit your API credentials** to version control
- Store credentials securely and rotate them regularly
- The server only requires the permissions you grant via the Trello token
- Consider using environment variables for credentials in production
